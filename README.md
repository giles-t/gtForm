gtForm
======

Custom angular directives to help with everyday form problems!

- gt-form-alerts: Bootstrap alerts angularified with the ability to have multiple targeted alerts on any given page.
- gt-form-btn-disable: Neat directive to disable all buttons on a page and replace target with css class (to add spinner/custom styles/ect...). Useful for ajax form submits.
- gt-form-init-view: Simply fires a function on whatever scope it's placed, good for executing reporting calls that require asynchronous templates to be loaded.
- gt-form-mask: Originally designed to mask phone numbers, now it masks anything! (This one is still a work in progress)
- gt-form-match: Simple directive to compare the values of two input elements.
- gt-form-validation: Awesome form validation that displays icons (with ui.popovers) when form is dirty/invalid/valid.

## Todo

This is still a work in progress and is nowhere near complete, things to do:
- Tests
- Documentation
